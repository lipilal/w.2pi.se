In this SEO-friendly description, we delve into the potential lineup choices for Arsenal, considering recent form, tactical considerations, and player availability.<\/p>\n<p>Under the astute guidance of Mikel Arteta, Arsenal has undergone a period of transition, with the Spanish manager instilling a newfound sense of solidity and tactical discipline in the squad. As they gear up to take on Porto, Arteta faces the challenge of selecting a lineup capable of overcoming their Portuguese opponents and securing maximum points.<\/p>\n<p>In goal, Bernd Leno is likely to retain his place as Arsenal&#8217;s first-choice goalkeeper, bringing a wealth of experience and shot-stopping ability to the team. Leno&#8217;s commanding presence between the sticks provides a sense of assurance to the Arsenal defense, instilling confidence in his teammates.<\/p>\n<p>In defense, Arteta has several options at his disposal, with the likes of Ben White, Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es, and Takehiro Tomiyasu offering solidity and versatility across the backline.
